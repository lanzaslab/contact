   Distribution (Defunct)}
\usage{
contactTest(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{emp.input}{List or data frame containing contactDur.all or 
contactDur.area output refering to the empirical data. Note that if 
emp.input is a list of data frames, contacts used in analyses will be 
determined by averaging contacts reported in each list entry.}

\item{rand.input}{List or data frame containing contactDur.all or 
contactDur.area output refering to the randomized-path data. Note that if
rand.input is a list of data frames, contacts used in analyses will be 
determined by averaging contacts reported in each list entry.}

\item{dist.input}{List or data frame containing dist.all/distToArea function
output refering to the empirical data. Note that if test == "chisq," a 
dist.input argument is required. If test == "mantel," however,
dist.input can be set to NULL. This input is used to determine the  
number of durations that each pair of individuals (or individuals and 
fixed locations/polygons if dist2Area output is used) were observed 
during the same timestep (i.e., the maximum number of durations dyad 
members could potentially be in contact with one another).}

\item{test}{Character string. Describes the statistical test used to 
evaluate differences. Currently only takes the values "chisq," or 
"mantel." Defaults to "chisq." More tests will be added in later 
versions.}

\item{numPermutations}{Integer. Number of times to permute the data given
test == "mantel."}

\item{alternative.hyp}{Character string. Describes the nature of the 
alternative hypothesis being tested when test == "mantel." Takes the 
values "two.sided," "less," or "greater." Defaults to "two.sided."}

\item{importBlocks}{Logical. If true, each block in emp.input will be 
analyzed separately. Defaults to FALSE. Note that the "block" column must
exist in emp.input.}

\item{shuffle.type}{Integer. Describes which shuffle.type (from the 
randomizePaths function) was used to randomize the rand.input data 
set(s). Takes the values "0," "1," or "2." For tests other than 
"chisq" this value is irrelevant.}
}
\value{
Output format is dependent on \code{test} value.

   If \code{test} == "chisq," output will be a list of two data frames.
   The first data frame contains pairwise analyses of node degree and total 
   edge weight (i.e., the sum of all observed contacts involving each 
   individual). The second data frame contains results of pairwise analyses 
   specific dyadic relationships (e.g., contacts between individuals 1 and 
   2). Each data frame contains the following columns: 
   
   \item{id1}{the id of the first individual involved in the contact.}
   \item{id2}{designation of what is being compared (e.g., totalDegree, 
   totalContactDurations, individual 2, etc.). Content will 
   change depending on which data frame is being observed.}
   \item{method}{Statistical test used to determine significance.}
   \item{statistic}{Test statistic associated with the specific method.}
   \item{p.value}{p.values associated with each comparison.}
   \item{df}{Degrees of freedom associated with the statistical test.}
   \item{block}{Denotes the relevant time block for each 
   analysis. (if applicable)}
   \item{warning}{Denotes if any specific warning occurred during analysis.}
   \item{empiricalContactDurations}{Describes the number of observed events
   in emp.input.}
   \item{randContactDurations.mean}{Describes the average number of observed
   events in rand.input.}
   \item{empiricalNoContactDurations}{Describes the number of events that 
   were not observed given the total number of potential events in 
   emp.input.}
   \item{randNoContactDurations.mean}{Describes the average number of events
   that were not observed given the total number of potential events
   in rand.input.}
   \item{difference}{The value given by subtracting 
   randContactDurations.mean from empiricalContactDurations.}

   If \code{test} == "mantel," output will be a single data frame with the
   following columns:
    
   \item{method}{Statistical test used to determine significance.}
   \item{z.val}{z statistic associated with the specific method.}
   \item{p.value}{p.values associated with each comparison.}
   \item{emp.mean}{mean contacts in the emp.input overall or by block (if 
   applicable).}
   \item{rand.mean}{mean contacts in the rand.input overall or by block (if
   applicable).} 
   \item{alternative.hyp}{The nature of the alternative hypothesis being 
   tested.}
   \item{nperm}{Number of permutations used to generate p value.}
   \item{warning}{Denotes if any specific warning occurred during analysis.}

\description{
This DEFUNCT function is used to determine if tracked individuals in an 
   empirical dataset had more or fewer contacts with other tracked 
   individuals/specified locations than would be expected at random. The 
   function works by comparing an empirically-based contactDur.all or 
   contactDur.area function output (emp.input) to the contactDur.all or 
   contactDur.area output generated from randomized data (rand.input).
}
\details{
Note: The current functionality is limited to comparisons using the 
   X-squared "goodness of fit" test or Mantel test for evaluating 
   correlations between two matrices. Please note that the output of this 
   function changes based on what test is run. The assumptions and 
   intricacies associated with running these tests here are described below 
   in brief. 
   
   X-Squared (chisq.test): In this function, chisq.test is used to compare 
   the distribution of observed inter-animal or animal-environment contacts 
   in an empirical dataset, emp.input, to a distribution described in a NULL
   model, rand.input (i.e., expected contact counts). This test requires 
   equidistant TSWs (temporal-sampling windows; see the tempAggregate 
   function) in each movement path within dist.input. The dist.input (i.e., 
   output from dist.all or dist2Area functions) is used here to determine 
   how frequently each individual was observed in the empirical 
   dataset/block of interest, allowing us to calculate the number of TSWs 
   each individual was present but not involved in contacts. Note here that 
   if X-squared expected values will be very small, approximations of p may 
   not be correct (and in fact, all estimates will be poor). It may be best 
   to weight these tests differently. To address this, We've added the 
   "warning" column to the output which notifies users when the chisq.test 
   function reported that results may be inaccurate. 
   
   Mantel test (ape::mantel.test): tests for similarity of the emp.input to 
   rand.input. Please note that ape::mantel.test does not allow for missing
   values in matrices, so all NAs will be treated as 0. Output is a single
   data frame describing the test results.

This function was inspired by the methods described by Spiegel et al. 2016. 
   Who determined individuals to be expressing social behavior when nodes 
   had greater degree values than would be expected at random, with 
   randomized contact networks derived from movement paths randomized 
   according to their novel methodology (i.e., shuffle.type == 2). Here, 
   however, by specifying a p-value threshold, users can also identify when 
   more or fewer (demonstrated by the sign of values in the "difference" 
   column) contacts with specific individuals than would be expected at 
   random. Such relationships suggest social affinities or aversions, 
   respectively, may exist between specific individuals.

Note:The default tested column (i.e., categorical data column from which 
   data is drawn to be compared to randomized sets herein) is "id." This 
   means that contacts involving each individual (defined by a unique "id") 
   will be compared to randomized sets. Users may not use any data column 
   for analysis other than "id." If users want to use another categorical 
   data column in analyses rather than "id," we recommend re-processing 
   data (starting from the dist.all/distToArea functions), while specifying 
   this new data as an "id." For example, users may annotate an illness 
   status column to the empirical input, wherein they describe if the 
   tracked individual displayed gastrointestinal ("gastr"), respiratory 
   ("respr"), both ("both"), illness symptoms, or were consistently healthy 
   ("hel") over the course of the tracking period. Users could set this 
   information as the "id," and carry it forward as such through the 
   data-processing pipeline. Ultimately, they could determine if each of 
   these disease states affected contact rates, relative to what would be 
   expected at random.

Note: if importBlocks == TRUE, a "block" column MUST exist in emp.input. 
   However, a "block" column need not exist in rand.contact. If no 
   "block" column exists in rand.input, empirical values in all emp.input 
   blocks will be compared to the overall average values in rand.input.
   Block columns will also be appended to function outputs.
