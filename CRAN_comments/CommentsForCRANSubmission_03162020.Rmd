```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Test environments
* local macOS Catalina (10.15.3), R 3.6.2
* winbuilder (release) #note: I tried passing the package to devel multiple times over the past couple of days, but was always presented with "Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = h) : Failed FTP upload: 550" and the transmission is aborted. Googling the error indicates that this is often an error unrelated to the package or my local system.

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs 

## Downstream dependencies

There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
