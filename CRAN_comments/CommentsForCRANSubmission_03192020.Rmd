1 NOTE: "Days since last update: 3"
  - I apologize for updating the package again so soon. I received an email from ripley@stats.ox.ac.uk indicating that ver. 1.2.0 had broken \donttest examples which must be corrected by 04/02/2020. This was due to an undiscovered bug introduced in ver. 1.2.0. It has now been fixed.
